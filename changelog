0.2
---

Keeping up with the Scotty 0.6 updating. The introduction of the
custom exception types is reflected in the `scotty-hastache` package
as well. The main types are now polymorphic over an exception type

    type ScottyH e = ScottyT e HState
    type ActionH e = ActionT e HState

In addition, the specialized (to `Text`) types and runners are
introduced

    type ScottyH' = ScottyH Text
    type ActionH' = ActionH Text
    scottyH'     :: Port -> ScottyH' () -> IO ()
    scottyHOpts' :: Options -> ScottyH' () -> IO ()


Thanks to Kirill Zaborsky for pointing out the incompatibility with 0.6.
